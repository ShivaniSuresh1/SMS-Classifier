# SMS Classifier using Python

## Overview

This Python project is a simple SMS classifier that categorizes text messages into predefined categories like "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The classifier is implemented using machine learning techniques and can be employed for tasks such as filtering unwanted messages.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy nltk
```
Clone the repository using the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-classifier.git
cd sms-classifier
```

## Customization
Feel free to customize and extend the project according to your needs:
*Modify the feature extraction process in train_classifier.py to improve the model's performance.
*Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and parameters.
*Enhance the classification output or integrate the model into a larger application.
